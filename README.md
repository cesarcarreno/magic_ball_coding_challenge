## Magic Ball Animation ##

## Description ##
This project uses Javascript, CSS and HTML to work. I animated a ball in a specific area using JavaScript. I changed the styles of the balls using CSS in the document. It is structured so that it resembles an eclipse because of the white background and multiple balls match that color. 

## Installation ##
Both of the files need to be in the same folder and it's recommendable for them to be renamed. 

## Usage ##
There are many ways to change the balls for many projects. Other similar examples could emulate planet movements in our solar system. Imagine that the sun was at the center and the balls represented earth moving around it.
